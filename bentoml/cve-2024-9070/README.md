# vulnerble version setup

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-vulnerable.yml up
```
Run the exploit by specifying a URL that will receive the callback. For example, you can host a temporary server with:

```
nc -klnv <port>
```

Then, run the exploit with:

```
echo "https://<callback-host>:<port>" | python3 exploit.py
```
you'll receive a http request on port 1337 which means the exploit worked.
