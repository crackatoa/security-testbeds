# Setup for the vulnerable version.

Start the vulnerable container:
```sh
docker compose up
```

Create a listener (e.g. ncat):
```sh
ncat -klnv 1337
```

Run the exploit:
```sh
python3 exploit.py
```

You should receive an HTTP request in the ncat window with the contents of the OS command (`id` by default) if everything worked as expected.
