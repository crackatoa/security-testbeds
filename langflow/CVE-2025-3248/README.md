# Langflow CVE-2025-3248

This directory contains the deployment config for Langflow instances vulnerable and fixed to CVE-2025-3248. Langflow versions below 1.3.0 are vulnerable to that unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability.

## How to Trigger the Vulnerability?

To trigger the vulnerability, you can use the exploit.py file directly. It will execute the "cat /etc/passwd" payload, parses the payload, and gives the exact command result directly, if it is vulnerable.

```sh
python3 exploit.py http://localhost:7860/
```

In case you cannot trigger the vulnerability, you might need to delete your existing container images because Docker might try to reuse them.

```sh
sudo docker rmi -f $(sudo docker images -aq)
sudo docker remove $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
```
## Fixed version
```sh
docker run -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env langflowai/langflow:1.3.0
```

The deployed service listens on `localhost:7860` after the docker completes its job.

## Vulnerable version
```sh
docker run -p 7860:7860 --env-file .env langflowai/langflow:1.2.0
```

The deployed service listens on `localhost:7860` after the docker completes its job.
